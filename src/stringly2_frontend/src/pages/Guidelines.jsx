            <p className='text-[24px]'>Stringly is deeply committed to maintaining a safe and respectful platform for all users. We strictly prohibit any form of child sexual exploitation or abuse, including content that sexualizes, exploits, or endangers children. This includes photos, videos, text, illustrations, or any material involving inappropriate conduct related to children. Sharing or encouraging others to share child sexual abuse material (CSAM) is a serious violation and will lead to immediate account removal and reporting to the relevant authorities.</p>
            <p className='text-[24px]'>Discussions or content involving children must always be lawful, appropriate, and relevant. If users choose to include photos of children in their profiles, these must depict fully clothed children and include adults in the image. Photos where children appear alone or any images featuring genitalia or buttocks, even partially covered, are not permitted.</p>
            <p className='text-[24px]'>Stringly adheres to all applicable laws and cooperates with organizations like the <a className='text-blue-700 border-b-2 border-blue-700' href='https://www.missingkids.org/HOME'>National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC)</a> to address suspected cases of CSAE. Users can report violations via the “Report Abuse” feature, and appeals against enforcement actions can be submitted through our support channels. If you have any questions, need support, or wish to contact us, please reach out to us at <a className='font-sf font-semibold cursor-pointer' href='mailto:support@stringly.com'>support@stringly.com</a>.</p>
